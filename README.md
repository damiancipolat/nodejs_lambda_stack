# Functional programming in Javascript
I have been a javascript programmer for a long time and I have seen this language grow, from a simple tool to validate forms with jquery, to be able to create large backend platforms. Since ES6 appeared and the ability to add "classes" I see that it has only caused a confusion in the way of programming, making a javascript code as a migration from java. 

Since I came across functional programming I saw how it adapts perfectly to the potential of javascript and how it achieves a much better clarity in the way of writing code.

### What is functional programming (FP)?:

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm in that programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative programming where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state can affect a function's resulting value. Eliminating side effects, that is, changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make understanding a program easier, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.
